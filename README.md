# Octopus Player
Octopus music player for Android

Migration from Google Code


## Turning on Kotlin
As [Kotlin]( https://kotlinlang.org/ ) a new official Android programming language (second after Java), Octopus Player will be tried to be implemented with this language.
As the Kotlin programmer beginner I am, I see it as a mix of Java and Python: 
really close to Java and C-Like languages, seems easy to go from Java to Kotlin on the "way of programming", and with the syntax simplicity of Python (no semicolon needed, no indentation needed).
Kotlin seems to be very powerful and simple to read and write. Let's go for it!

New directory contains Kotlin project, aside Java directory that contains the current Java version under development.



## New version under construction
* All source code and content from old version available (Ressources)
* Will be setup on AndroidStudio to make smartphone version
* Probably working on a Java (Kotlin?) desktop version
